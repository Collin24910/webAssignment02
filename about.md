# Who Am I?
-------
I'm currently a graduate student at Rowan University studying computer science, as well as a software engineer at ASRC Federal. I have a passion for building excellent software that improves the lives of those around me. I specialize in creating intuitive and well written software for any project that I pursue.

Ever since learning the potential of software development in my first intro class to programming back in high school I've pushed myselft to hone my ability to create software that I would be proud to have my friends and family use. That's why i strive to create clean and well designed code.
